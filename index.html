            A major challenge when using supervised learning techniques is the scarcity of labeled data. The problem
            arises due to the significant amount of human work hours required to perform the labeling and also in
            some cases the necessity of experts (eg: labeling bio-medical images) to perform the task. As a solution
            to this problem active learning approaches have been used to support the human annotator. In this
            project we explore different variations of active learning methods which intelligently select data
            points from the large unlabeled dataset and use the small labeled dataset to train classifiers for
            detecting tumorous areas in MRI images of patients with brain tumor. Mainly three sampling methods,
            namely Least confident sampling, Margin sampling and Entropy sampling are evaluated. Along with them
            three uncertainty measures are used. They are Feature uncertainty, Geometric uncertainty and Joint
            uncertainty. Joint uncertainty is a newly proposed measure of uncertainty that captures the difference
            in feature and geometric probabilities. Out of all the methods evaluated, Margin sampling with feature
            uncertainty gives the best results. By just using 2% of the complete training dataset, this method is
            capable of achieving ~96% of the dice score that is achieved when using the 100% of the dataset. The
            results achieved with three sampling methods by using feature uncertainty is given in the figure on
            right.
